    "#### First Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a notebook the markdown cells are usually 'rendered' meaning they have been processed to yield the intended output. Very much like the html 'code' that is behind a webpage. Your task in this lab is to follow along with this guide and try out a variety of the basic tools that you will use every time you write your lab report.\n",
    "\n",
    "1: To access the markdown syntax that produces the desired output you can 'double click' on this cell. When you do so you should see things change inside this particular unit of the notebook. This unit is called a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "2: When you want to see the rendered version of the cell 'shift-return' will render the active cell (the one with the blue bar next to it on the left). Try these two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the text and other markdown syntax much like you do in a standard word processing program. You will find that you can **NOT** edit the text or syntax when the cell is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: To create a new cell use the '+' at the top of your notebook window. \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brash99/PH211/master/images/notebookMenu.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new cell after the currently active cell. When you do so the new cell will, by default, expect that it is a code cell. This is indicated by the small brackets to the left of the cell.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brash99/PH211/master/images/codeCell.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "To let the notebook know that you want it to be a markdown cell select 'markdown' from the dropdown menu just below the notebook title.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brash99/PH211/master/images/cellType.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the small brackets have disappeared.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brash99/PH211/master/images/markdownCell.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To be sure that the images display correctly in this notebook and in the final .pdf I needed to reference the image to a source on the public web. After a number of attempts this seems to provide a stable solution. The necessary images need to be resident in the repo for this to work. This also solves the problem for students who have downloaded the notebook but not the image folder."

    "- underneath the title the date, the class, and your name\n",
    "- a list of your group mates from the lab or folks you worked with\n",

    "You could just edit this notebook to produce this result but if you do that you will lose a number of useful references for how to do things like embed images (first cell), lists (this cell), or hot links (next cell) in your lab report. My recommendation is to go to the Jupyterlab 'File' menu and open a new notebook. The new notebook will show up in a separate tab in the Jupyterlab window. Again, in the 'File' menu, use 'Save Notebook As' to save this new notebook with a useful name. Now you will have both this set of instructions and your personal lab notebook open at the same time. "

    "\n",
    "LaTex was created as a typesetting language to allow high levels of control over the production of technical and scientific documents. As a stand alone system it is common for graduate schools in all the physical sciences to require LaTeX for theses. Many science and engineering journals require document submissions as LaTeX files. Some undergraduate programs require LaTeX documents for math or engineering homework. Having said all that it is important to note that LaTeX is not common or universal in the professional engineering world. On the other hand python notebooks are much more common. Given that we are often using notebooks to communicate technical content which is rich in math having a tool that allows us to present mathematics more effectively is of real value. Many of the LaTeX formatting tools for math are available within the markdown syntax. This is how we will use it in physics and why you are being asked to learn this skill."
